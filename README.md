# PWA Swipe Card Game

This project is a simple progressive web app (PWA) built for Cloudflare Pages. The game presents a deck of cards that can be swiped left or right on mobile screens.

## Gameplay
1. The first card asks **"Would you like to enlist as Tzar?"**. Swipe right for yes or left for no. You must answer this card to continue.
2. Depending on your answer, a shuffled deck of 20 questions for either **Tzar** or **Citizen** is displayed.
3. Each card can be swiped right (yes) or left (no). After you answer, the next card slides into view.

## Development
All files are static and can be deployed directly on Cloudflare Pages.

### Run locally
Just open `index.html` in a modern browser. The service worker caches files for offline access.
